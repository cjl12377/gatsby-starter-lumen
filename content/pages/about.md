Hi, I'm Jeng Long! I'm a final year medical student in Singapore. This blog is a timeline of ideas I'm developing as I explore my interests. Borrowing the idea of [working with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu) from Andy Matuschak, this blog is and always will be a feature of evolving ideas, thoughts and small projects. I believe a process of presentation, critique and reiteration is central to growth (and fun!)
