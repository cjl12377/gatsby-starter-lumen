The main principles of Ultralearning as laid out by [Scott Young](https://www.scotthyoung.com/).

# Principles:

1. Meta-learning - Draw your map
2. Focus 
3. Directness - Go straight for it
4. Drill - go for the weakest points, the ones you don't feel like doing
	> “By identifying a rate-determining step in your learning reaction, you can isolate it and work on it specifically. Since it governs the overall competence you have with that skill, by improving at it you will improve faster than if you try to practice every aspect of the skill at once. That was Franklin’s insight that allowed him to rapidly improve his writing: by identifying components of the overall skill of writing, figuring out which mattered in his situation, and then coming up with clever ways to emphasize them in his practice, he could get better more quickly than if he had just spent a lot of time writing."
	- Direct-Then-Drill Approach
		- early in learning, cycle quickly, even in the same learning session
5. Retrieve - test yourself
	1. The more difficult it is, the more retention
	2. The choice on what and how much to retain depends on its application 
	3. Should I do the exam before the class begins?
		1. Creates an attentional priming for relevant info
6. Feedback - Don't dodge the punches
	1. 3 types of feedback:
		1. Outcome feedback - Achieved or not achieved
		2. Informational feedback - A more granular feedback on specifc sub-outcomes
		3. Correctional feedback - what is wrong and how to change?
	2.  Ignore the un-useful feedback, the feedback that doesn't describe a way to improve
	3. Learning which feedback to ignore
		1. Consistency of feedback may be more useful when converting informational feedback to correctional feedback
7. Retention
8. Intuition
9. Experimentation
