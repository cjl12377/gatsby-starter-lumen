# Micro-decisions:

They say its the small choices we make that determine how we make larger decisions.

Presently, I'm struggling with 2 conflicting values. Resilience vs Focus.

This seems ridiculously small but I think it reflects well how I think of all my actions and that I overthink everything.

As I was about to start work, I noticed I was sweating, the sun was glaringly hot and it was a hot day. I felt uncomfortable, less comfortable than I'd like to be when concentrated on work. My mind reflexively went to turning on the aircon.
But I paused. I was also trying to train myself to be more resilient. To go after my goal, face my obstacles head on and go through them, not around them.
I decided not to turn on the aircon.

Now, there's a few ways to view this. In principle or in terms of outcome. There are too many factors that determine that outcome so I don't even remember whether the heat played a large role in the productive time I had. Maybe I was more productive than if I had enjoyed respite from the heat. I don't think I could confidently know.

So, I look in principle. In principle, resilience determines that I should do my work despite the heat. On the other hand, Focused work means to acknowledge my resources, obstacles and goals and make an informed decision to optimize work. One would suffer at the expense of the other.

# How should I overcome this dilemma?
Is it possible to practice focused work in 1 period and resilience in another context where returns were higher? Say, in the gym.
If willpower is a limited resource (and it likely is), and resilience is not built by bulldozing through every obstacle obtusely, then is the answer to make an informed decision that optimizes the practice of resilience and the practice of focused work where the costs (willpower) are lowest and the returns (focused work) are highest?

On the other hand, it is easy (and even likely!) that turning on the aircon reinforces the knee-jerk reaction to alleviate suffering when it presents. This erodes our resilience in suffering.

# How then?
Mindful awareness of what presents in our mind allows us to observe, acknowledge and then respond with an informed and collected mind. This makes the best possible decision at relative to the context, and not in absolute terms.
To break this down, I was going to reflexively turn on the aircon but I noticed that I was doing this as a knee-jerk reaction to alleviate suffering. Ultimately, I chose resilience over a comfortable work as I thought I could still work adequately despite the heat. Was this the right trade-off? No one knows. But it was an informed decision because I was aware of where I was being pulled and where I wanted to go. Even principles, in absolute terms, can be misguiding if they are at the helm instead of a collective intention.

# Conclusion:

>Be aware of our influences. Be aware of where we want to go and why. Make an informed, collective decision. 

In this case, retrospectively, my choice is to turn on the aircon. Practice resilience later, in the gym. Or put resilience into my dedication to focus.
In the next time, it'll be something different.

# Problems I see with this approach:

- Constant evaluation taxes the mind
- some sort of balance between active evaluation of all present parts, and a model/principles
